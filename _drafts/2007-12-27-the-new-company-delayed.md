<div id="msgcns!C840C88DA912213B!1067" class="bvMsg"><p>&quot;Amid turmoil in the debt capital markets, Intel, Francisco Partners and STMicroelectronics have delayed the closing of Numonyx, its joint flash memory venture, to March 28, 2008.&quot;<br />-- EEtimes.com</p> <p>Well, this is not unexpected.</p> <p>Our management team has been striving to make this happen. Various reasons were given and different excuses were taken. It is no wonder the big bosses want to earn more by save more. Employee's welfare was the last thing they would like to consider, of course, in China. Perhaps I am being too pessimistic, yet it is a daily fact that the new company will run smoothly even without a China R&amp;D center. The only reason they don't cancel the this R&amp;D center is that they need to show the Chinese govornment that Intel is willing to leverage its High-Tech capability to China, all in the exchange of this fast growing IT market.</p> <p>Just check out what Intel is doing in Da Lian. All the equipments are old and out-of-date. They call it a &quot;new&quot; Fab. Americans build their Fabs in the desert of Ohio while Fab 68 is to be constructed in this most beautiful coast city of China. Everybody is happy, no one hears the cry of our motherland.</p> <p>Unwillingly, I regard these transnational companies as aliens. And they are just waging a war upon us. This is not like cold war. It's a new war, called globalization. Of course its a sweet dream that our earth will soon become a global village. But please remember, some one needs poor neighbours.</p></div>
