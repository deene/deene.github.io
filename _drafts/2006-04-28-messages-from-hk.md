<div id="msgcns!C840C88DA912213B!724" class="bvMsg"><div>I think I am writing on the same computer in the same chair as I did on the first day when I arrived in HK two year ago. The same rain, the different me. At that time I was such a little boy that I am a bit afraid of this new world.</div>
<div>Today is the 2nd day of my visit. This morning I hung around the campus, searching for those things deep down in my memory. Those figures, those laughters, those chattings...I once thought I was in a dream when sitting beside the Lotus Pool in the center of HKU. Even I can't destinguish between memories and reality. Too many things have been changed and too many remain the same...</div>
<div>I can't speak of anything, I can only feel. Never ever have I got such a feeling that the world could be unreal...</div></div>
