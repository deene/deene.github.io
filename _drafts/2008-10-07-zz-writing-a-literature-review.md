		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3"><b>What is a Literature Review?</b></font>

		     

		    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">A literature review is a survey and discussion of the literature

			in a given area of study.  It is a concise overview of what has been studied, argued, and established about

			a topic, and it is usually organized chronologically or thematically.  A literature review is written in 

			essay format.  It is not an annotated bibliography, because it groups related works together and discusses 

			trends and developments rather than focusing on one item at a time.  It is not a summary; rather, it 

			evaluates previous and current research in regard to how relevant and/or useful it is and how it relates to

			 your own research.</font>

			 <blockquote><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3"><i>A Literature Review is <b>more</b> than an Annotated Bibliography or a summary, because you are organizing

			 and presenting your sources in terms of their overall relationship to your own project.</i></font></blockquote>

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3"><b>Purpose</b></font>

		   

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">A literature review is written to highlight specific 

		   arguments and ideas in a field of study.  By highlighting these arguments, the writer attempts 

		   to show what has been studied in the field, and also where the weaknesses, gaps, or areas needing 

		   further study are.  The review should therefore also demonstrate to the reader why the writer’s 

		   research is useful, necessary, important, and valid.</font>

		   

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3"><b>Audience</b></font>

		   

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Literature reviews can have different types of audiences, 

		   so consider why and for whom you are writing your review.  For example, a lot of literature reviews are 

		   written as a chapter for a thesis or dissertation, so the audience will want to know in what way your 

		   research is important and original.  Highlighting the gap in knowledge which your research aims to fill 

		   is particularly important in this instance because you need to convince the reader that there is an 

		   opening in the area of study. A literature review in a proposal will similarly try to convince the 

		   audience of the significance and worthiness of the proposed project. In contrast, when you are writing a 

		   literature review for a course, your professor may want you to show that you understand what research has 

		   been done, giving you a base of knowledge.  In this case, you may not need to focus as much on proving 

		   where the gaps in knowledge lie, but rather, that you know what the major areas of study and key ideas 

		   are.</font>

		   

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3"><b>Questions a Literature Review Should Answer:</b></font>

		   		   

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Asking questions such as the following will help you sift 

		   through your sources and organize your literature review.  Remember, the literature review 

		   organizes the previous research in the light of what you are planning to do in your own 

		   project.</font>

		   <ul><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><li>What's been done in this topic area to date? What are the significant discoveries, key 

		   concepts, arguments, and/or theories that scholars have put forward? Which are the important works?

		   

		   <li>On which particular areas of the topic has previous research concentrated? Have there been 

		   developments over time? What methodologies have been used?

		   <li>Are there any gaps in the research? Are there areas that haven't been looked at closely yet,

		   but which should be? Are there new ways of looking at the topic?

		   <li>Are there improved methodologies for researching this subject?

		   <li>What future directions should research in this subject take?

		   <li>How will your research build on or depart from current and previous research on the topic? What 

		   contribution will your research make to the field?

		   </li></li></li></font></ul>

		   

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3"><b>Length</b></font>

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">The length of a literature review varies depending on its 

		   purpose and audience.  In a thesis or dissertation, the review is usually a full chapter (at 

		   least 20 pages), but for an assignment it may only be a few pages.</font>

		   

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3"><b>Structure</b></font>

		   

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">There are several ways to organize and structure 

		   a literature review.  Two common ways are chronologically and thematically.</font>

		   

		   <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>Chronological:</b>  In a chronological review, you

		    will group and discuss your sources in order of their appearance (usually publication), 

			highlighting the changes in research in the field and your specific topic over time.  This 

			method is useful for papers focusing on research methodology, historiographical papers, and 

			other writing where time becomes an important element. For example, a literature review on 

			theories of mental illness might present how the understanding of  mental illness has changed 

			through the centuries, by giving a series of examples of key developments and ending with 

			current theories and the direction your research will take.</font>

			

			<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>Thematic:</b>  In a thematic review, you will 

			group and discuss your sources in terms of the themes or topics they cover.  This method is 

			often a stronger one organizationally, and it can help you resist the urge to summarize your 

			sources.  By grouping themes or topics of research together, you will be able to demonstrate 

			the types of topics that are important to your research. For example, if the topic of the 

			literature review is changes in popular music, then there might be separate sections on 

			research involving the production of music, research on the dissemination of music, research 

			on the interpretation of music, and historical studies of popular music.</font>

			

			<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b><i>No matter which method you choose, remember:</i></b> 

			Within each section of a literature review, it is important to discuss how the research relates

			 to other studies (how is it similar or different, what other studies have been done, etc.) as 

			 well as to demonstrate how it relates to your own work. This is what the review is for: don’t 

			 leave this connection out!
