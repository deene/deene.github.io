<div id="msgcns!C840C88DA912213B!909" class="bvMsg"><div>So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.<br />Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil?<br />Do you think you can tell?<br /><br />And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees?<br />Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change?<br />And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?<br /><br />How I wish, how I wish you were here.<br />We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,<br />Running over the same old ground. What have you found? The same old fears.<br />Wish you were here.<br /></div></div>
