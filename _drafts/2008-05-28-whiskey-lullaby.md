Title: Whiskey Lullaby</strong></span>



这是一首值得细细品味的歌曲，无论是歌曲本身还是歌曲背后的故事。事实上，仅仅开始的几个音符就已足够勾起我的忧伤。

<span style="color:#993300;">她和他是一对恋人，爱得如胶似漆。</span>

<span style="color:#993300;">这时候，战争开始了，男人踏上了战场。临走前他们发誓战争，结束后要永远在一起。
不久，女人听说爱人在战斗中牺牲，痛不欲生，于是放任自己沉沦堕落。</span>

<span style="color:#993300;">但命运总是弄人，当这个男人数年后回来时见到的是女人的背叛，他不知道女人的痛苦和无奈，也没有给她解释得机会。他只是逃避着，不停地喝着WHISKY，任由自己沉浸在痛苦之中。终于有一天，他喝光了最后一瓶WHISKEY，朝自己的脑袋扣响了扳机……</span>

<span style="color:#993300;">其实，没有人知道女人心中的自责，也没有人给过她解释的机会。自从男人死后，她也选择了酒精来麻痹自己的痛苦。终于有一天，走到尽头的女人也扣动了扳机...</span>

<span style="color:#993300;">故事的结局，他们终于还是在另一个世界又走到了一起。</span>

<span style="color:#003366;"> She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night</span>

<span style="color:#003366;">1st Chorus
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her till I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby</span>

<span style="color:#003366;">(Sing lullaby)</span>

<span style="color:#003366;">The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night</span>

<span style="color:#003366;">2nd Chorus
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby</span>

<span style="color:#003366;">(Sing lullaby)</span>
