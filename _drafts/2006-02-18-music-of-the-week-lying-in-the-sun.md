<div id="msgcns!C840C88DA912213B!612" class="bvMsg"><div><font color="#ffcc99">Lying in the Sun, by Stereophonics, one of my favourite bands.</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>这首歌送给我上一篇blog里的那位老人，也送给所有曾经或是将要和我擦肩而过的人们，无论你是贫穷还是富贵，物质或是精神上。</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99">Wish I could lie in the sun<br />Same things as anyone<br />Wish I could lie down there<br />With my feet high in the air</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99">I'd love a drink in my hand<br />read words from a newspaper stand<br />Wish I could lie in the sun<br />Wish I could fly like everyone<br />Same things as anyone</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99">But you burn me and you paint my skin<br />in bad designs that aint even in<br />My skins crawling up the wall<br />Into the ocean I'd love to fall<br />I hear the sounds but they aint the same<br />as feeling them with you two feet away</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99">There's always more worse off than me<br />suppose I am lucky I can even see<br />All the people that I'd like to be<br />Passing me by everyday in the street<br />The same things as anyone</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99">But you burn me up you paint my skin<br />in bad designs that aint even in<br />I got good lungs, got a good heart<br />My mind is fit, and my feet can walk</font></div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#ffcc99">And here I am in the shade on the street<br />Asking people for money to eat<br />What did I ever do to deserve this?<br />Did I kill a child or something worse?<br />The same things as anyone<br />What's the reason maybe make you feel<br />How much more fortunate you are than me?</font></div></div>
