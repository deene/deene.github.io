<div id="msgcns!C840C88DA912213B!948" class="bvMsg"><div>The fear for death strikes me hard these days.</div>
<div>Every night when the darkness falls, and all light out, I am frightened, fearing, that I will some day end in empty. Not feeling anything, not thinking of anything, not relevant to this world...</div>
<div>I am afraid of that day.</div>
<div>I don't want to die.</div></div>
