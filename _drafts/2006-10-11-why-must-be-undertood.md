<div id="msgcns!C840C88DA912213B!887" class="bvMsg"><div>As qq said, those who step into my blog may not step into my heart. Sounds sad, right? But, why so sad? Who in the world dare say he fully understands or is fully understood? No one I believe is so lucky. We don't have to understand a person before make friend with him.</div>
<div>Friendship is not some mysterious psychoacitivy that requires a devotion of heart and soul. It's simply a mutual attraction. I feel good with you and you the same with me. That's all.</div>
<div>And think more, is it so good as to be fully understood?  You may call this lucky but I really doubt it...</div></div>
