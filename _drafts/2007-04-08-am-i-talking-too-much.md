<div id="msgcns!C840C88DA912213B!959" class="bvMsg"><div>I still remember how silent and shy I was in the old days, I mean the days when I was a child.</div>
<div>Was a child? Ironic. I didn't even know when I became a man. Looking into the mirror and I ask, are you a man or still a little boy full of innocence? After five minutes' unconciousness I recovered, lost at the answer which was supposed to jump out so quick.</div>
<div>I talk too much. IÂ was a boy who used to hide in the shadow behind the door and peep through the crowd. I enjoyed being ignored but staying awake while others sleeping.</div>
<div>I want to get back.</div>
<div>Find myself the shadow and fit me in.</div>
<div>Me existence.</div></div>
