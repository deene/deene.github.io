<div id="msgcns!C840C88DA912213B!644" class="bvMsg"><div>This is the English origin of the previous Chinese version:</div>
<div> </div>
<blockquote>
<div>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”</div>
<div>— Frank Herbert, Dune - Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear </div></blockquote></div>
