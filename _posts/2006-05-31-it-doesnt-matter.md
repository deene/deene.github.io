<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">It doesn't matter what I want<br />It doesn't matter what I need<br />It doesn't matter if I cry<br />Don't matter if I bleed<br />You've been on a road<br />Don't know where it goes or where it leads<br /><br />It doesn't matter what I want<br />It doesn't matter what I need<br />If you've made up your mind to go<br />I won't beg you to stay<br />You've been in a cage<br />Throw you to the wind you fly away<br /><br />It doesn't matter what I want<br />It doesn't matter what I need<br />It doesn't matter if I cry<br />Doesn't matter if I bleed<br />Feel the sting of tears<br />Falling on this face you've loved for years</font><br /></div></div>
