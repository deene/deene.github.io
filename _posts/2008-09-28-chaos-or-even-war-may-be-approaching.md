<div id="msgcns!C840C88DA912213B!1202" class="bvMsg"><div>The American Bailout deal is said to be near, according to CNN earlier today.</div>
<div>(<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/28/bailout.deal/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/28/bailout.deal/index.html</a>)</div>
<div>And this morning I saw a blog commenting on this deal. (<a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_482c47c00100b0l0.html">http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_482c47c00100b0l0.html</a>) The blogger expressed his worries on this bailout. And just now I accidentally ran into some friend's blog and saw the following letter by the econimists regarding this bailout. (<a href="http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/john.cochrane/research/Papers/mortgage_protest.htm">http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/john.cochrane/research/Papers/mortgage_protest.htm</a>).</div>
<div>All of these stuff make me feel really bad. The bailout may save the wallstreet, temperarily, but I worried that it will pull the world downto deeper water. If the oil and gold price keeps rising up, China will be in terrible troubles. And the world will be in big troubles thereby.</div>
<div>The authorities all know about this situation. Let's just pray the leaders of the world will finally work out a good solution, for the sake of our humankinds.</div>
