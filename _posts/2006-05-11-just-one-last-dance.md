<div id="msgcns!C840C88DA912213B!778" class="bvMsg"><div>So sad a song...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just one last dance....oh baby...just one last dance </div>
<div>We meet in the night in the Spanish cafe<br />I look in your eyes just don't know what to say <br />It feels like I'm drowning in salty water <br />A few hours left 'til the sun's gonna rise <br />tomorrow will come an it's time to realize <br />our love has finished forever </div>
<div>how I wish to come with you (wish to come with you) <br />how I wish we make it through </div>
<div>Chorus: <br />Just one last dance <br />before we say goodbye <br />when we sway and turn round and round and round <br />it's like the first time <br />Just one more chance <br />hold me tight and keep me warm <br />cause the night is getting cold <br />and I don't know where I belong <br />Just one last dance </div>
<div>The wine and the lights and the Spanish guitar <br />I'll never forget how romantic they are <br />but I know, tomorrow I'll lose the one I love </div>
<div>There's no way to come with you <br />it's the only thing to do </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just one last dance, just one more chance, just one last dance<br /></div></div>
